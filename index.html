       <h3 class="Ab">About</h3> 
       <p>Growing up, music was always a significant part of my life. My father used to play his vinyl collection on Sunday mornings, filling our home with the sounds of classic rock and jazz. As I got older, I found myself exploring different genres and discovering new artists, often feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of music available. </p>
       <p>I wanted to create a tool that would make it easier for people to find new music they love, just as I found my way to new favorites through my father's records. This project is a tribute to those cherished Sunday mornings and a way to help others navigate the vast world of music.</p>
